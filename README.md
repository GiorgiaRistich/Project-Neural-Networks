# Project-Neural-Networks
This repository contains our project for the exam of Neural Networks. 

## Description
The projects consists in implementing the paper [Gradients without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08587.pdf). 
In particular, the paper introduces a new method to compute the gradient of an objective function for optimization that is based on forward mode instead of reverse mode (backpropagation). So, the key idea is to evaluate the gradient in a single forward run of the function eliminating the need of backpropagation. 
The final algorithm to implement is the following:
